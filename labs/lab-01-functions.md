# Lab 1 / Functions

## Part 1: Function styles

Write three functions: 
- `getMean`: Calculate the average of five numbers. Should be a function declaration.
- `getMode`: Out of five numbers, calculate the number that appears most often. Use a function expression. 
- `getMedian`: Out of five numbers, which number is in the middle, in terms of value. Use an arrow function.

Test the code out. Use node to run your code.

## Part 2: Function arguments

Rewrite the functions in part 1 to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, using rest parameters.

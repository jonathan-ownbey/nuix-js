# Lab 3 / Objects

## Part 1
 Re-write the code from the previous lab to return an object with the following key-value pairs:

 - average: the average of all values passed in
 - median: the median of all values passed in
 - mode: the mode of all values passed in

 When testing the results, use object destructuring to assign the results to three separate variables.

 STOP HERE.

 ## Part 2

 Create a person object that contains the following properties:

 - firstName
 - lastName
 - city
 - state

 Write a function `greetPerson`. It should take a person as an argument and return a greeting of "Hello, firstName lastName!".

 Use object destructuring to break up the argument into separate variables within the function. This should be done in
 the function signature (the arguments list).

STOP HERE.

## Part 3

Write a function `shallowClone` which returns a shallow clone of any object passed to it.  
In the function itself, use the spread operator to create a shallow clone of the argument passed in.
